Some days ago I made a [little patch](http://abisso.org/index.php/2009/05/social-links-plugin-with-relme-identica-and-bitbucket-support/) for Social Links, [Tommaso](http://tommyblue.it) pointed me to a [strange behaviour](http://i40.tinypic.com/14vtimt.png) if used with LightBox 2 Plugin.

So I decided to fork Social Links and today ["About Me"](/index.php/projects/about-me) is born.
