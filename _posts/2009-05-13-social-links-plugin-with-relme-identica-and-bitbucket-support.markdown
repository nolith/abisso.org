UPDATE: I've forked Social Links, please refer to [About Me](/index.php/projects/about-me/).


![Social Links screenshot with Identi.ca and Bitbucket](/assets/images/social_links.png) Today I made a little patch of [Social Links Wordpress Plugin](http://blog.maybe5.com/?page_id=94) in order to add [identi.ca](http://identi.ca), [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org) and [Github](http://github.com) support and for adding `rel="me"` tag to the generated links (see [XFN](http://gmpg.org/xfn/) for more details).

I've uploaded the plugin on [my bitbucket](http://bb.alessiocaiazza.info/about-me/), so you can see [the diff with Social Links 1.0.11](http://bb.alessiocaiazza.info/about-me/diff/?diff2=277ec9c01cd6&diff1=ccf8fe183f72). If you want to install it, go to the [download page](http://bb.alessiocaiazza.info/about-me/downloads/).
